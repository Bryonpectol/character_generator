            <h1>About The Person Generator</h1>

            <br />

            <p class="aboutp">The Person Generator is an amazing piece of software that lets you randomly generate a person with a huge amount customization options. Right now there are a total of 803,212,281 different options you could randomly get when creating your person. So, there is only a 1 in 803,212,281 percent chance that you would get a duplicate randomized person. That huge number does not even include the person's age, Attributes section of the person, or some parts of the Appearance section like height and weight. Although there are a lot of customization options already, I am continuing to create more first and last names, occupations, hobbies, and more. If you enjoy using The Person Generator or it has helped you with a task of yours, please consider donating! Any amount helps and would tell me, as the creator, that this website is worth updating and adding new features.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="aboutp">Here are some new features that will come out in future updates:</p>

            <ul class="aboutp">
                <li>Option to change the planet and galaxy the person is from.</li>
                <li>A randomly generated picture that resembles the person that you've generated.</li>
                <li>Different languages that the person speaks.</li>
                <li>I would be glad to take any other suggestions from you! Please send a message to me via the support page if you have any suggestions or feedback.</li>
